# GitHub Copilot - TDD Verification

## Test 1 - Basic Sum

- Wrote a test for the `sum` method (i.e. `sum.test.ts`).
- Ask GitHub Copilot Chat to provide an implementation.
- Gave an implementation of `sum` that passes the test.

## Test 2 - FizzBuzz

- Wrote test for first 3 return value for FizzBuzz.
- GitHub Copilot Chat provided the full implementation of FizzBuzz.
- Suspect this is due to the coding puzzle being quite well known.
